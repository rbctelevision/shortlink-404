# shortlink-404

A custom 404 error page designed for short links, hosted at [https://404.rbctv.xyz](https://404.rbctv.xyz).

## Overview

This repository contains the HTML and assets for a minimalist and branded 404 page, intended to be displayed when short URLs on 404.rbctv.xyz don’t resolve. It’s a simple yet effective fallback for missing or expired links.

## Repository Contents

- `.github/workflows/` – Github pages configuration files.
- `index.html` – The main HTML file defining the 404 error page layout and content.
- `light-bulb.png` – A lightbulb image (because why not).

The project is built entirely with HTML.

## Usage

To deploy your own version of this 404 page:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rbctelevision/shortlink-404.git
   ```
   

2. Install a HTML Server

   ```
   npm i -g http-server
   http-server
   ```

###### You can use your own live HTML server of choice, but I would recommend using the http-server package on npm (providing you have node.js installed):
